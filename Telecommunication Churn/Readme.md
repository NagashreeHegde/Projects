# ðŸ“ž Telecom Customer Churn Prediction 

## Project Statement

Customer churn is a major concern for telecom companies,losing customers not only affects revenue but also increases the cost of acquiring new ones. This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn based on their behavior, usage patterns, and subscribed plans. By identifying customers likely to leave, companies can take proactive measures to retain them.

## ðŸ’¼ Business Relevance

This project addresses a critical business problem faced by the telecom industry:

- **Reduce customer churn** by identifying at-risk users early
- **Improve customer retention** through targeted marketing and better customer service
- **Optimize business strategy** by understanding key churn drivers like international plans, service calls, or high usage charges
- **Save costs** associated with acquiring new customers by retaining existing ones

A well-performing churn model enables data-driven decisions that improve long-term customer loyalty and revenue stability.

## ðŸ”„ Project Workflow

1. **Problem Understanding & Business Goal**  
   Understand churn impact and frame it as a binary classification problem.

2. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
   Analyze customer behavior data and prepare it for modeling.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize trends and identify important features contributing to churn.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   Convert categorical variables, scale numerical values, and create relevant derived features.

5. **Model Building**  
   Train and compare classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to evaluate performance.

7. **Model Deployment**  
   Deploy the final model using **Streamlit** to create an interactive web application.
